- **JWT Authentication:** Endpoints are secured, requiring a valid token for access.
- **SQLite Backend:** Simple, file-based, and reliable data persistence.
- **Automated Folder Creation:** Creates a standardized directory structure for each new job.
- **MQTT Event Publishing:** Broadcasts a `job.created` event for other agents.
- **Containerized:** Runs entirely within Docker via a simple `docker-compose` command.
- **Automated Testing:** Includes a full suite of unit tests with `pytest` and automated CI via GitHub Actions.

## Advanced Usage

### Pagination

The `GET /jobs` endpoint supports cursor-based pagination.

`GET /jobs?limit=20&cursor=<last_id>`

This will return a JSON object with `items` and a `next_cursor`. To fetch the next page, make the same request again, passing the received `next_cursor` value in the `cursor` query parameter.

### Generate an Admin JWT

You can generate a long-lived token for administrative or testing purposes using the built-in CLI.

```bash
python -m app.cli create-token admin --minutes 1440

### Development Conventions
- Python formatting & linting enforced via pre-commit (Black + Ruff).
- Line endings: LF enforced via `.gitattributes`.
- Run `pre-commit install` after cloning.
